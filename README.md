Final project for CS4620 at Ohio University

#INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Check if you're using python3. (You can do so using python --version on Mac), this requires Python3 to run, so install that if you do not have it. 

From there...
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install tabulate 
python3 user_query.py

It should run from here!
